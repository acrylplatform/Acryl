# Acryl [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/acrylplatform/Acryl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/acrylplatform/Acryl)

Acryl is an open source [blockchain platform](https://acrylplatform.com/).

You can use it to build your own decentralised applications. Acryl provides full blockchain ecosystem including smart contracts language called RIDE.

### How does the blockchain network work?

There is a huge collection of nodes deployed by miners that store all of the network information in the chain of blocks (blockchain), process requests and can add new transactions to the network after checking their compliance with the rules. The miners are rewarded with the network coins called MRT. 

The main advantage of this technology is that each node is a synchronized copy of the main blockchain: it means that the information is stored decentralized and won't be overwritten globally if one of the users changes it at one of the node storages. This can guarantee that the user's information will stay fair and unchangeable. 

# How to Build and Test a Node

The node can be built and installed wherever java can run. For ***Ubuntu***,sbt packageAll ‌produces only deb package but for other operating systems, ZIP archive or a fat JAR can be used as well. To build and test your Acryl Node, you will need to follow these steps:

## 1. Setup the environment

- ### Installing Java

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install default-jre default-jdk
```

- ### Installing SBT

Please follow the SBT installation instructions depending on your operating system ([Mac](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.0/docs/Installing-sbt-on-Mac.html), [Windows](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.0/docs/Installing-sbt-on-Windows.html), [Linux](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.0/docs/Installing-sbt-on-Linux.html)).

## 2. Obtaining Source Codes

Cloning with HTTPS URLs (recommended)
```
git clone https://github.com/acrylplatform/Acryl.git
cd Acryl
```
or cloning with SSH URLs
```
git clone git@github.com:acrylplatform/Acryl.git
cd Acryl
```

## 3. Compilation and unit tests

```
sbt checkPR
```
* if test failed, you should increase memory limits:
```
SBT_OPTS="-Xms512M -Xmx8192M -Xss128M -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=8192M" sbt checkPR
```

## 4. Running NODE integration tests (optional)

Create a Docker image before you run any test: `sbt node-it/docker`

- Retrieve the list of available tests: `sbt node-it/printTests`
- Run all tests: `SBT_THREAD_NUMBER=4 sbt node-it/test` . You can increase or decrease number of parallel running tests by changing `SBT_THREAD_NUMBER`
- Run one test: `sbt node-it/testOnly *.TestClassName` or `node-it/testOnly full.package.TestClassName`

## 5. Building packages

- ### Mainnet

```
sbt packageAll
```

- ### Testnet

```
sbt -Dnetwork=testnet packageAll
```

## 6. Installing DEB package

DEB package located in target folder. You can replace '*' with actual package name:

```
sudo dpkg -i node/target/*.deb
```

## 7. Running fat jar

You can replace acryl-all*.jar with actual jar name (it should have "all"-word):

```
java -jar node/target/acryl-all*.jar path/to/config/file
```

**Note.** For OSX - homebrew is preferable choice. You can install java with brew cask install java and sbt with brew install sbt@1. Build/Test steps are common for any OS (but you should use ‘' instead of '/' in windows). {% endprettyhint %}

## 8. Running an extension project locally during development

### SBT

```
sbt "extension-module/run /path/to/configuration"

```

### IntelliJ IDEA

1. Click on `Add configuration` (or `Edit configurations...`)
2. Click on `+` to add a new configuration, choose `Application`
3. Specify:
   - Main class: `com.acrylplatform.Application`
   - Program arguments: `/path/to/configuration`
   - Use classpath of module: `extension-module`
4. Click on `OK`
5. Run this configuration 

## 9. Contributor notes

### Branches

* `master` is a developers' branch;
* `NODE-XXX` is a feature or a bug fix branch;

A new tag with a version number is created for the release. The latest release for each network can be found in the [Releases section](https://github.com/acrylplatform/Acryl/releases)
